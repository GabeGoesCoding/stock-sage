# Stock Sage

## Overview

Stock Sage is a dashboard for investors to access historical pricing data using AlphaAdvantageâ€™s public API.
Queries may be saved to a list for referencing in the future. For each query, an investor will add a name for the query, and an opportunity to add notes for documenting their thoughts about a data response. These notes will be accessible from a list of queries from the API.
Investors will also be able to review their recent queries if they feel like going back to review and save a query.
